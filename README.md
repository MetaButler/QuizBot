## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get your instance of **QuizBot** up and running.

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Option A**: Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your secure values for username, password, and DB name:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   Update the values in the `.env` file.

2. **Option B**: Directly modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and hardcode the database credentials:

   ```yaml
   POSTGRES_USER: yourusername
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpassword
   POSTGRES_DB: yourdbname
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Bot Settings

1. Copy `sample_config.yml` to `config.yml`:

   ```bash
   cp sample_config.yml config.yml
   ```

2. Update the `config.yml` file:
   - Set the `telegram.bot_token` and other necessary settings.
   - Ensure the `database.schema` matches the credentials from Step 1.

### Step 3: Configure Alembic

1. Copy `sample_alembic.ini` to `alembic.ini`:

   ```bash
   cp sample_alembic.ini alembic.ini
   ```

2. Edit the `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini` to match the `database.schema` from Step 2.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Bot

1. Pull the necessary database image, build the bot image, and start the bot:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --detach
   ```

2. To stop the bot, run:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
