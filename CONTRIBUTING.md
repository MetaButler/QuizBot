## üõ† How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

- First, fork the [QuizBot GitHub repository](https://github.com/MetaButler/QuizBot) to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your fork locally:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/quizbot.git
  cd quizbot
  ```

### 2. Create a New Branch

- Always make sure to work on a new branch for your contributions:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```

- Make sure your branch name is descriptive of the changes you are making. For example:
  - `fix-typos-in-readme`
  - `add-quiz-category-feature`
  - `refactor-database-module`

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Ensure your code is clean and well-documented. Use comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
- Stick to the existing code style and naming conventions.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

- Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add description of your changes"
  ```

- Try to group related changes into single commits and ensure each commit represents a meaningful step.

### 5. Push to Your Fork

- Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

  ```bash
  git push origin your-branch-name
  ```

### 6. Open a Pull Request

- Once your changes are pushed, open a pull request to the **main** branch of the original repository:
  - Go to the original QuizBot repository and click the "New Pull Request" button.
  - Select your branch as the source and `main` as the destination.
  - Provide a detailed description of the changes you‚Äôve made, referencing any related issues or feature requests.
  - Follow the pull request template, if provided.

## üí° Guidelines for Contributions

### Code Quality

- Maintain a consistent style across the codebase. QuizBot adheres to PEP 8 for Python code style.
- Break code into small, modular, and reusable components.
- Avoid duplicating code; if a similar piece of logic is used multiple times, refactor it into a separate function or class.
- Write descriptive commit messages. Each message should explain **what** was changed and **why**.

### Bug Fixes

- If you find a bug, feel free to fix it and submit a pull request. When doing so:
  - Ensure your fix doesn't break existing functionality.
  - Include a clear description of the bug and how your fix resolves it.

### Feature Requests

- If you're interested in adding a new feature, open an issue first to discuss your idea. Once approved, follow the process above to implement it.
- Make sure the feature is aligned with the project‚Äôs goals, and keep it as modular as possible.

### Documentation

- Documentation is crucial! If you're introducing new features or changing existing functionality, update or create relevant documentation.
- Keep the README.md file updated with any new feature additions or changes.
- If you're improving the docs, feel free to submit corrections or enhancements.
